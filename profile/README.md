👋  Hey, I’m **Alessandro Astarita** – partner, CEO & tech lead at [Capri Online](https://www.caprionline.it), where I design and build **Onda**, our platform powering multi-portal system for online booking for tours and local travel services.  

🌍  I split my time between London, Naples, and Capri, working remotely and keeping things running smoothly in the cloud.

🎸  When I’m not shipping code or contributing to open-source projects, you’ll find me [playing guitar](https://photos.app.goo.gl/A7VKwL5KLqU15dnr9), [teaching pop-rock ensemble](https://photos.app.goo.gl/L75oDRhrFf3HRaSZ6), or [riding my motorbike](https://photos.app.goo.gl/H1CBWRQqu3MsSPWP8) touring Europe with Alessia, my partner in life and adventure.
